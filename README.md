### 1. [Cointab Data Analyst Challenge](https://github.com/sanjanapaluri/Microsoft-Excel-Projects/tree/main/Cointab%20Data%20Analyst%20Challenge)

You are a data analyst and have a large ecommerce company in India (letâ€™s call it X) as a client. X gets a few thousand orders via their website on a daily basis and they have to deliver them as fast as they can. For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple courier companies in India who charge them some amount per delivery. On an average, the delivery charges are Rs. 100 per shipment. So if X ships 1,00,000 orders per month, they have to pay approximately Rs. 1 crore to the courier companies on a monthly basis as charges.
