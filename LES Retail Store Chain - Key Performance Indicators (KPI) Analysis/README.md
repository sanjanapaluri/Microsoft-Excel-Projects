## Data Requirements

Before we can create the reports, we need to gather and organize the necessary data. Since the provided amounts are blurred, we will calculate the KPIs based on available data.

### Data Sources:

2. **City and State Data:** Information about the city and state where each transaction occurred.

3. **Product Category Data:** Details about product categories, which will be used to categorize sales.

## Report Details

### Report 2: Product Sales for a Period

This report will analyze product sales for a specified period. It will include information on the most sold products, revenue generated, and quantities sold.



### Report 3: ARPU for City and State

ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) will be calculated for different cities and states. This will help understand revenue trends across different geographical regions.



### Report 4: Sales by Category with City Level Breakup

This report will break down sales by product category, providing insights into which categories are performing well in each city.


## Analysis Tools

To create these reports, we will use spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. These tools provide the flexibility to manipulate and visualize data effectively.
